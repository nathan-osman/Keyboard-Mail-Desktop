# Keyboard-Mail-Desktop
Repository for work on my Keyboard Mail project. This is the repository for the desktop application version, hopefully a mobile app version will follow the first stable release of the desktop version.

## Setup

The setup process is fairly simple if you're on Ubuntu. You may need to change the steps as needed for other Linux distros. Windows instructions will not be coming until later in the release cycle - perhaps on the initial beta release.

All that is required is

* Python 3 (3.4 is what I'm developing on, but any 3.x version should (*in theory*) work.

Once you've got Python 3.x installed, simply edit the credentials.py.template file to match your personal email credentials and then rename the file to credentials.py.

From there, simply run `python3 base.py`, and it will launch!
