# Keyboard-Mail-Desktop
Repository for work on my Keyboard Mail project. This is the repository for the desktop application version, hopefully a mobile app version will follow the first stable release of the desktop version.

For setup, simply edit the credentials.py.template file to match your personal email credentials and then rename the file to credentials.py.

From there, simply run `python3 base.py`, and it will launch!
